Your submission did not compile "out-of-the-box", but I have determined that the issue can
be patched easily.  You will not yet have received a score on Brightspace.  I am currently waiting
for a TA to do a re-run of the grading tests on the patched version of your submission and
will push the results and set your grade on Brightspace once this has been done.
In some cases, the failure to compile was not your fault, but in others, it was due to something
that you should have corrected.  For these other cases, there will likely be a small deduction
to your score.
